 * A file that multiple readers can safely read from and a single
 * writer thread can safely write too, without any synchronisation.

 * Implements the same API as AtomicFile, but avoids modifications
 * in openRead(), so it is safe to open files for reading while
 * writing, without losing the writes.
 * <p>
 * It uses two files: The specified one, and a work file with a suffix. On
 * failure, the work file is deleted; on success, it rename()ed to the specified
 * one, causing it to replace that atomically.
